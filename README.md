# Schnitzel Frontend
*Still in development*

Schnitzel is open-source social network made for posting your recipes or show off with what you cooked.

It is built with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for database, [ExpressJS](https://github.com/expressjs/express) as backend, [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react) as frontend, [NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs/node) for javascript runtime (MERN stack)

Future features are all the things I am planning to add in the future updates:

 - Real time notifications (points, comments, posts, new follower, dm's)
